# eips-wtf

EIPs.wtf provides extra information for Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), including their status, implementation details, related pull requests, and community feedback. It's another way to keep on top of changes to the Ethereum protocol through a "timeline" feed and graphs on what's being worked on.
